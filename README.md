# SignatureGenerator
this is a project to be used in tandem with cheat engine, it helps making Signature scanning a whole lot easier!

It will ask you two questions,
Your first Array of Bytes then close the game or crash or whatever to update changes,
then your second Array of Bytes. It will sift through the two of them, if there are inconsistencies with the numbers,
then they will turn into "?" which is essential to signature/pattern scanning in the first place. You always
wanna have a unique signature.
